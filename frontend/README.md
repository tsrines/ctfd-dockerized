To get started with this repo, you first need the backend up and running. Visit <https://github.com/tsrines/ctfd-back> if you don't have your rails server up and running. This app requires a facebook developer account. If you want to test out the app using my credentials, check out the deployed version at <https://kind-neumann-eeb20b.netlify.app/>. There, you can use the Guest User information below. In development, however, you can mirror the "env.template" in root folder with your credentials.
